Every session is instantly transcribed, structured, and anchored on-chain using the latest low-cost protocols on Solana and Polygon — the cheapest high-performance networks available.

            <h2>The on-chain intelligence layer for Web3 fundraising.</h2>
            <p>
              AI Scout is the on-chain intelligence layer for Web3 fundraising. We turn live, in-person founder interactions at Hacker Dojo into tamper-proof, machine-readable data stored permanently on Solana or Polygon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founders pitch in front of real Silicon Valley investors and experts. You watch it live on Twitch and YouTube. AI Scout captures everything — pitch, demo, investor reactions, follow-ups — then mints it as immutable on-chain records.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our live auctions, conducted with crypto tokens on Prediction Markets for crypto and stablecoins, enable compliant, real-time capital formation while staying strictly within USA legal frameworks. The result: the highest-signal, lowest-trust data and transaction pipeline in crypto.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t decide for you. We give you the raw, verifiable truth so your AI agents, DAOs, and investment committees can act faster and with real conviction.

Every auction is recorded immutably alongside the pitch data, creating a seamless, compliant bridge between Silicon Valley deal flow and Web3 capital. This is the safest, most transparent way to move from pitch to funding in the crypto space.

              Blockchain fundraising still runs on blind trust — and that’s exactly why so many projects fail or turn out to be rugs. AI Scout kills the trust issue at the root: every founder is pressure-tested live in Silicon Valley’s most active pitch arena, then the entire session plus live auctions using crypto tokens on Prediction Markets for crypto and stablecoins are etched permanently onto the cheapest, fastest blockchains on earth while staying fully within USA legal frameworks.
            </p>

              Investors and DAOs finally get the same level of live, expert-vetted intelligence that traditional VCs enjoy — but now fully transparent, on-chain, compliant, and accessible to anyone with a wallet.
